## Overall Vibes

--

- fully worth it
--

- good food & well organized
--

- San Diego is pretty cool
--

- hex stickers!

## Opening Keynote

Di Cook, advisor to Hadley & Yihui
--

- `ggplot2` not only user-friendly, but enables plots as another statistic
--

- key takeaway: embed _true_ plot among _permuted_ plots and see if others can pick out the true plot
--

## Asynchronous Operations in Shiny

Joe Cheng, CTO @ rstudio & creator of Shiny
--

- what happens if you run a model in an app, and someone else tries to connect?
--

- new [`promises`](https://github.com/rstudio/promises) package coming
    - another weird pipe: `%...>%`
    - uses `futures` underneath
    - requires support in shiny itself, currently on [`shiny` branch](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny/tree/async)
--
- not specific to shiny
--

- [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/jcheng5/r-promises)

---

## Functional Testing in Shiny

Winston Chang talking about [`shinytest`](https://github.com/rstudio/shinytest)
--

- functional testing using a headless browser
--

- less fragile than `RSelenium`
--

- easy to use: record yourself clicking on stuff
--

- replay from generated code
--

- returns json & jpg
--

- json plays nice with version-control and CI
--

- already has an [rstudio page](https://rstudio.github.io/shinytest/articles/shinytest.html)
--

- [slides](https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio-conf/blob/master/2018/Shinytest-Winston_Chang/2018-02-02-RStudioConf-shinytest.pdf)

## Scaling Shiny

Sean Lopp, software dev @ RStudio
--

- demonstrated scaling a shiny app to to 10,001 concurrent users!
--

- built on AWS
    - RDS, ALB, EFS, ASG (auto-scaling groups)
    - RStudio Connect cluster in the ASG
--
- other tools used
    - Prometheus & Grafana for metrics
    - Fabric (python) for orchestrating the whole thing
--
- new, unreleased `shinyloadtest` tool to fake users
    - very efficient: should be able to support ~1k connections from a laptop
--
- [slides](https://github.com/slopp/shinyloadtest-results/blob/master/slides.pdf)

## Modeling in the Tidyverse

Max Kuhn, Applied Predictive Modeling, `caret` package, RStudio
--

- `modelr` is dead!
--

- Max is clearly embracing the pipeline concept (smells like `sklearn`)
    - going beyond `recipes`
--
- unified model interface means you specify a _type of model_ and a _compute target_
    - e.g. `random forest` and `Spark`
    - don't worry about `randomForest` vs. `ranger` vs. `sparklyr::ml_random_forest` vs. ...
--
- After he nails down some interface/syntax stuff, everything else will come quickly

---

## Modeling in the Tidyverse

--

- packages that already exist
    - [`rsample`](https://github.com/topepo/rsample) for setting up bootstrap, CV, etc.
    - [`recipes`](https://github.com/topepo/recipes) for preprocessing (scaling, centering, etc.)
    - [`tidyposterior`](https://github.com/topepo/tidyposterior) for post-hoc analysis of model stats
    - [`yardstick`](https://github.com/topepo/yardstick) for computing model metrics
    - [`parsnip`](https://github.com/topepo/parsnip) for unified model interface
--
- Slides available on [Github](https://github.com/topepo/rstudio-conf) ([rawgit](https://cdn.rawgit.com/topepo/rstudio-conf/a6d9176bdc62f38c7d6773a8bcc2e6f1d4399536/2018/Modeling_in_the_Tidyverse--Max_Kuhn/Modeling_in_the_Tidyverse.html#1))

## Machine Learning with R & Tensorflow

J.J. Allaire, founder & CEO @ RStudio
--

- been in a cave the last couple years wrapping many TF tools for R
--

- 3 levels of API to TF
    - low: [`tensorflow`](https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/tensorflow/)
    - medium: [`tfestimators`](https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/tfestimators/)
    - high: [`Keras`](https://keras.rstudio.com/)
--
- several others like [`tfdatasets`](https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/tools/tfdatasets/) and [`tfruns`](https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/tools/tfruns/)
--

- worked with Francois Chollet to make an R version of [Francois' deep learning book](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-r)
--

- this is why [`reticulate`](https://github.com/rstudio/reticulate) exists; always wrapping python because TF's C++ API doesn't expose the good stuff
--

- [`Greta`](https://greta-dev.github.io/greta/) is a STAN-like MCMC library in R built on TensorFlow (not from RStudio)
--

- [slides](https://beta.rstudioconnect.com/ml-with-tensorflow-and-r/)

---

## CloudML

--

- [CloudML](https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/) is google's managed TF-model service to make it all easier
    - training, tuning, deployment, etc.
--
- R package [`cloudml`](https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/tools/cloudml/articles/getting_started.html)
    - claimed this wrapper is far more feature-complete than anything in any other language (including python!)

---

## TF Deploy

Javier Luraschi, RStudio

--

- [`tfdeploy` package](https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/tools/tfdeploy/articles/introduction.html) helps deploy trained TF models to many places
    - TF Serving, CloudML, RStudio Connect
--
- even better, he used [`keras-js`](https://github.com/transcranial/keras-js) + `xaringan` to deploy a trained model _inside his slides_!
--

- [slides](https://rpubs.com/jluraschi/deploying-tensorflow-rstudio-conf)

---

## Zeallot

Nathan Teetor talking about his [`zeallot`](https://github.com/nteetor/zeallot) package
--

- offers python-like value unpacking on LHS of assignment
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(zeallot)

c(a, b) %<-% c(1, 2)
c(a, b) %<-% list(1, "foo")
c(a, c(b, c)) %<-% list(1, list("foo", "bar"))
c(res, err) %<-% purrr::safely(log)("whoo")
c(mpg, ...) %<-% mtcars
c(., ., disp, ...) %<-% mtcars
c(mpg, ...rest) %<-% mtcars
```
--

- easy to implement your own "destructor" for custom objects (demonstrated with `quosures`)
--

- [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MISSEW5-JIulvjsmGETsdLWrgXoncFhb2i2E65KXwi0/edit?usp=sharing)

---

## Stuff I missed

- Drill-Down Reporting in Shiny
    - Barbara Borges Ribeiro, RStudio, `pool`
    - Tableau-like click-through modals in Shiny
    - [slides](https://rawgit.com/bborgesr/rstudio-conf-2018/master/presentation/presentation.html)
--
- [`infer`](http://infer.netlify.com/)
    - tidyverse-friendly framework for hypothesis testing
--
- Understanding PCA on Stack Overflow data
    - Julia Silge, Stack Overflow, `tidytext`
    - [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/juliasilge/understanding-principal-component-analysis-using-stack-overflow-data)
